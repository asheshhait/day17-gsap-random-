🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (with Google Fonts)

JavaScript (jQuery + GSAP 3.13)

Unsplash for sample images

⚙️ How It Works
h1 and h5 text split into <span>s for letter-by-letter animation

Images slide in with randomized positions and rotations

A .ripple <div> is created on every mouse movement, animated using CSS @keyframes and removed after 600ms
